# Tip Ranks Sales Data Mart - BI project
The database of final projects for the BI system development course at Experis Academy.

This project is dedicated to the creation of a comprehensive BI solution created for the TipRanks sales department, which includes selling data and reports developed in Power BI.

## Project review
Project specifications: Designing the database and reports, including creating essential documents such as ERD and source-to-target mapping. These artifacts provided the basic blueprint for the next stages of development.

## Data Mart Development:
Using SSIS for an ETL process to load OLTP data from the PriorityERP database, transform it and load it into the final Data Mart tables. Numerous data quality assurance tests were conducted throughout this process to maintain data integrity. The resulting database includes one fact table, four-dimensional tables, and one history table.

## Power BI reports:
This step involved creating additional tables, calculated columns, and measures using DAX to support the visuals, then proceeding to create and design the visualizations. 3 reports were created: TipRanks OverView, Users Details, Sales Details.
